            You may remember that towards the end of last month, Pickle had some issues with her foot. Specifically, we
            found out that she had broken her nail while running around in some rocks on one of our hikes. Over a few
            weeks we spent some time hanging around Huntington Beach and Long Beach to stay around the vet clinic that
            was treating her foot. Every three days we'd go in to get a check in on her status, and every three days her
            foot was getting worse. Either infection, moisture, or some combination of both were preventing Pickle from
            making a speedy and full recovery. Trish and I realized that living in the van was putting a strain on her
            recovery as she didn't have a sterile home or routine in which to recover. We had no space for her crate in
            the van and keeping her on strict rest was a strong part of her proposed recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pickle's injury was, at the time, a nudge in the direction of what would become our final decision to sell
            the van and find a place together.

            On a daily basis on the road, we were realizing that a lot of our time was spent getting things in order.
            Either we were finding a place to park for the night, dumping our gray water, filling up on fresh water, or
            spending time at the gym using our membership for showers. After Elton would finish work for the day, it was
            an immediate rush to the gym, get a workout in, setup somewhere to cook dinner, and then find a place to
            stay for the night. By the time we settled in, we'd be exhausted and would have no mental or physical energy
            to do anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trish starts vet school in August, and we realized that this lifestyle would not be the most conducive to
            her success at UC Davis. It was this realization along with the want for Pickle to recover quickly that
            cemented our decision.

            We scuttled back to San Diego, detailed, serviced, and put the van up for auction on Cars and Bids â€” a
            process that was both eye opening and super stressful. Elton spent a week getting detailed photos of every
            aspect of the van, answered potential buyers questions, and making sure the van was represented online as
            accurately as possible. Unfortunately, he literally got no work done the day of the auction as a bidding war
            started in the final 20 minutes resulting in the end time being extended almost an hour.
        </p>

            On 4/20 with 69 bids (a fact Elton cannot get over), the auction ended below reserve. We were linked up with
            the highest bidder and are working out the final details of the sale now.

            We recognize that we still have a ton of free time and a huge opportunity to travel, so we'll continue to do
            that; however, instead of trying to live it full time and balancing our work with our travel, we're going to
            be taking more after work and weekend trips with our 4runner.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll probably also take advantage of the fact that our home base is in San Diego this summer and get a ton
            of surfing in. Probably something we'll get less of once we're in Davis surrounded by cows and corn.

            This blog and our email newsletter will still be coming. Both of us can be bad about keeping in touch
            especially when things get busy and we think this has been a good practice for us to keep in touch with a
            lot of our close friends as we figure out these next few stages of our life together. Plus, we still have
            some great trips planned: Chicago in May, Banff and Squamish in July, Oregon, and potentially the lost coast
            all before school starts in August. We're excited to share these experiences with y'all.

            Since getting back to San Diego, Pickle has made a full recovery, Trish turned 23, and we signed a lease for
            our place in Davis! We had a barbecue to celebrate Trish's birthday, her Step-dad's birthday, and her uncles
            birthday. It was a great way to get the entire family together and eat a ton of chicken wings.
