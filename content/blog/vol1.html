        <h3>Hi there! Welcome.</h3>
        <p>After weeks of researching how to start van life, we found the perfect van for us and pulled
            the trigger in July
            of 2022.</p>
        <p>Meet Pam the (2016 Dodge) Ram Promaster 1500. we got her off of Facebook Marketplace from someone who was
            passionate about windsurfing and they added several unique and necessary features that translated well into
            what
            we wanted to use the van for.</p>
        <p>Since getting Pam we've taken several trips to Santa Cruz, Sequoia & Kings Canyon NP and we've made small
            adjustments and learned a lot of things along the way that we are so excited to share with our friends &
            family.</p>
        <h3>Why Van Life?</h3>
        <p>This is probably the second most asked question behind a van tour -- which is coming soon we promise :)</p>
        <p>To sum it up, we love camping, minimalism, and simplicity. We also haven't had much time to do the things we
            are passionate about like outdoor rock climbing, surfing, and exploring with Pickle. So here's to more of
            that in 2023.</p>

        <h3>What's Next?</h3>
        <p>We've had an incredible couple of years in Oakland, CA. It's where Trish & Elty met, moved in together, and
            made unforgettable memories with our bestest friends. However, our lease ends at the end of January and our
            first stop is a ski/snowboarding trip at Copper Mountain Resort in Colorado.
        </p>
        <p>Afterwards, we'd like to take our time to re-vist all the National Parks in Utah together. Then, we'll make
            our way down to Arizona and visit Saguaro NP and the Grand Canyon. </p>
        <p>Given that Trish's family is in San Diego, our home base will be alongside various San Diego beaches using
            our "California Explorer" State Park Annual Pass.</p>
        <p><b>More to come.</b></p>
