        <h4><b>WE ARE ENGAGED!</b></h4>
        <p>On March 3rd, 2023, Elton recreated our first date (vegan food and a picnic at Lake Merrit in Oakland, CA)
            and asked the big question. We are overjoyed and have been enjoying a month of celebrating the news and
            spending time with close friends and family.</p>

        <p>The first two weeks of March, we spent back in Oakland with our old housemates and best friends. Although not
            everyone was home, it was so nice to go back to having dinner together every night, re-watching the hunger
            games movies, eating bottomless bowls of frosted mini wheats cereal, and attempting to catch the resident
            rat, rattus rattus - that's first name Rattus & last name Rattus. We're looking forward to heading back up
            to the Bay Area again at the end of summer for another visit before vet school starts.</p>

        <p>After Oakland, we drove back to San Diego to recoup and plan as another set of atmospheric rivers were
            expected to hit the coast in the next couple of weeks. In the meantime, we took advantage of being in one
            spot for a couple weeks as Trish got a set of Rabies vaccinations in preparation for veterinary school and
            Elton replaced the rear struts and suspension system in the van — resulting in much smoother and quieter
            rides.</p>
        <p>Trish also showed Elton the best zoo in the ENTIRE world, San Diego Zoo & Safari Park. </p>

            We've heard that Baja is one of the most van-life friendly places in the world—the locals are very accepting
            and
            there aren't any stigmas regarding van lifers. Furthermore, we've been wanting to plan a longer surfing trip
            (2+
            weeks) there. However, there is also a lot of concerns regarding safety and due to the fact that we want to
            be
            in SD at the end of April and start heading to Chicago in May we've decided against squeezing in the trip at
            the
            end of march/beg of April and instead aim to head to Baja in July. In the meantime, being that Elton is from
            Northern California and hasn't explored much of Southern California we've been exploring this area for the
            past
            3 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>We first went to San Clemente, a cute little surf town an hour north of San Diego. We grabbed drinks at Bear
            Coast Coffee and walked across the street to the pier and watched surfers. With the sun blazing and the cool
            ocean mist on our faces—it was such an idyllic morning and exactly what we had hoped to do more of since
            starting van life. Then we did a beachside hike at Pico Park Sea Summit Trail. Afterwards we went into town
            and visited Beach Town Books - which we'd highly recommend everyone to check out if you're ever in the area.
            For an afternoon pick me up, we also recommend Southswell, an ice cream shop that specializes in hand dipped
            ice cream and unique toppings. Lastly, we didn't have time to make a stop here but we love getting
            lunch/picking up local organic produce at the Ecology Center in San Juan Capistrano. They are an awesome
            organization dedicated to teaching the youth and community about regenerative agriculture. </p>

        <p>A real standout of our time in LA County was the naples canal. It's a little island with a canal running in a
            circle around the center. Along the canal there are a bunch of really cool and cute houses and its a great
            place for an afternoon / evening walk.

        <p>Next we drove to Pasadena in Los Angeles to celebrate Elton's grand-big from his college business
            fraternity's wedding. It was a great night with good food and a chance to catch up with old friends from
            college he hasn't seen since 5 years ago when he graduated.
        </p>
        <p>This past week we've really settled into a routine when it comes to living out of the van. We'll spend a
            workday at a local coffee shop or Starbucks, workout and take our showers at the gym, and then settle in
            wherever we're at for the night with an episode of the show we're currently binging: Ozark. So far the
            biggest obstacle for us has been water management — figuring out where to safely dump our gray water and
            fill up our fresh water tank. With all of the necessities taken care of now and a basic daily routine set,
            both of us feel a lot more confident to take a longer trip like Baja or Chicago.
        </p>
        <p>It probably helps that quite a few Long Beach residents have camper vans as we've been finding it relatively
            easy to find overnight parking. There's an awesome spot that we've been frequenting that is right next to
            the beach and we've been falling asleep to the sound of ocean every night.

        <p>Somewhere along the way, Pickle hurt herself whilst doing some off-roading on some sharp rocks (she takes
            after her father) she broke her nail leading to an impromptu visit to the vet in Lakewood. It has been a
            tough recovery process as she's had several complications and we're finding ourselves having to go to the
            vet every couple of days to get frequent bandage changes and cleanings for her paw. Although we had more to
            explore, we made the tough decision to head back to San Diego to be better equipped to take care of Pickle's
            paw and give her a more sterile and stable environment to get better.

        <p>We hope we can still get back to LA in time to see the wildflower and California poppy super blooms in the coming weeks.
