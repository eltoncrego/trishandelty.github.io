            With one month of living full time in the van under our belt, it's safe to say we're becoming more
            comfortable
            with the feeling of everything being on the verge of falling apart. On one cold evening in Colorado whilst
            drying the dishes, we had the sudden realization that we didn't have much spare time anymore. Between
            driving,
            working, cooking, and spending time outside with Pickle, the time that we used to have at the end of the day
            to
            watch a show or movie has dwindled. Maybe its starting this new lifestyle in the midst of winter, but
            everything
            has been made extra arduous when living in 10º weather.
        </p>
        <p>
            The trials and tribulations of winter aside, life in the van has been amazing so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our first stop was Colorado, where we went skiing and snowboarding at Copper Mountain. We had the
            opportunity
            to break our travel up by staying in a hotel at the base of the mountain right off the ski lift! The feeling
            of waking up in the morning and skiing right on to the lift is something we are already missing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: If you're driving into CO or leaving, most likely you'll be taking I-70 through the mountains. We
            recommend monitoring the <a href="https://goi70.com/travel">goi70 site</a> and the <a
                href="https://opensnow.com/dailysnow/i70?utm_source=goi70&utm_medium=i70dailysnow&utm_campaign=2020-2021">OpenSnow
                site</a>
            for several days before and during the drive for the most accurate information about road and weather
            conditions.

            After a solid weekend of snow sports, we spent some time exploring Denver — settling into a rhythm of
            working remotely from various coffee shops and spending our evenings visiting local breweries and
            attractions like an eclectic, interactive art exhibit built by MEOW WOLF.

            We visited our first national park since moving into the van, Rocky Mountain (RMNP). The views and the
            feeling of being surrounded by the mountains was surreal. Also, walking on a frozen lake and hiking in the
            snow was entirely new to us. We quickly made a stop at the nearest REI afterwards and got us some
            micro-spikes so we would no longer feel like we were falling off the trail.
        </p>
        <p>
            After RMNP, we were so excited. We started making plans to visit all of the national parks in Utah before
            our upcoming climbing trip in Red Rocks, Nevada at the end of February. From Colorado it logistically made
            the most sense to visit Arches National Park first, then Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Bryce Canyon, and Zion
            last.

            We spent a weekend at Arches national park and it's surrounding city, Moab. It was 60° with sunny skies and
            absolutely beautiful. We did a short hike in the park to get our photos of the infamous Arches and then
            drove 30 min west to Jeep Arch Trail (4 mile out and back dog friendly hike on public land managed by the
            Bureau of Land Management, BLM). Pickle had a blast and practically had zoomies the entire hike. Taking
            advantage of the sun and the many van life accommodating spots in Moab such as free filtered water, dump
            stations, public showers, we did all of our chores (again), cleaned ourselves up nice, and treated ourselves
            to an early Valentines Day dinner at an incredible farm to fork restaurant called II Posto Rosso which is
            located inside the Radcliffe Hotel in Moab. If we had more time we would've visited Spanish Valley wineries
            just a couple more miles south if Moab that apparently has a noteworthy cherry wine and $20 tastings.
        </p>
        <p>
            After dinner we proceeded on our route to Capitol Reef National Park and stayed at a BLM spot off the
            highway that we found on iOverlander called 'Slabs from Athena Project' which was a missile testing launch
            site in the 60's. This night felt like a scene from a sci-fi movie as the street we turned in on was called
            Area 51 and there was a retired uranium mining mill on site as well.

            Elton did not sleep well here — having recently watched Chernobyl, it's a mystery why.

            One of our main chores entails emptying our greywater bucket (used sink water). Since it is a 5-gallon
            bucket we have to do this every 2-3 days depending on how much we are using the sink. You have to unscrew a
            plastic tube from the bucket from the metal sink drain. After doing this multiple times in extremely cold
            weather, the seal on the plastic tubing began to get stripped by the metal and began leaking the grey water
            everywhere under the sink cabinet. yuck. Given that the sink/running water is essential, we have to deal
            with this issue immediately. Unfortunately, we were already in the middle of nowhere, well on our way to
            Canyonlands National Park.
        </p>
        <p>
            After looking at the map, we had to double back to Moab as they had a dedicated plumbing store that would
            surely have the parts we needed to fix the leak. Sure enough we were able to pick up a new 4” sink stopper
            that interfaced well with the gray water plumbing and were back on track, albeit, having lost a day to
            double back. We decided, since Canyonlands features similar landscapes to Arches and Capitol Reef was a less
            popular park (due to how large it is and accessibility issues), we'd move along and spend more time there
            instead. That night, we parked the van around the town of Hanksville, Utah with high hopes of visiting
            Capitol Reef National Park after work the next day. (Note: unlike Arches/Canyonlands you will not have any
            service driving to Capitol Reef or in any of the surrounding towns inc. Hanksville. Additionally winter is
            an off-season for Utah National Parks and a lot of these towns have limited availability for doing pretty
            much anything).
        </p>
        <p>
            On Valentine's Day morning, while cooking heart shaped pancakes, the first flurries of snow hit the van. We
            were so excited. It felt like a dream as the town started to get blanketed in a light layer of snow. We
            decided to make our way to Capitol Reef before the snow got too hard to drive through, so we packed up and
            started the short drive to the park. For the last day we hadn't had cell service so as soon as we got to
            Capitol Reef Visitor Center we got some more information about an incoming snow storm that would last a
            couple days and many of the hikes at Capitol Reef and the other national parks were requiring permits to
            hike due to less than ideal conditions. Given this information we made a split decision to drive the 18
            hours back to San Diego and reset.

            We arrived at midnight and since then have been enjoying wonderful evening walks with Trish's family, eating
            delicious home-cooked meals, doing a deep clean of the van, and recharging before we head to Red Rocks at
            the end of next week.
        </p>
        <p>
            In light of recent developments, another winter storm has hit Southern California and neighboring states
            resulting in rain, hail, and snow in places that does not usually receive snow. Furthermore, our climbing
            trip got cancelled. We needed to be in South Bay by beginning of March, so upon news of the storm we quickly
            packed up the van and headed to the Bay Area before a necessary mountain pass on the I-5 highway closed due
            to snow and extreme winds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since being back in the Bay Area, we have just prioritized spending time with our friends and revisiting our
            old haunts. (Berkeley bowl west-the best grocery store of all time, rico rico taco, pacific pipe climbing
            gym, and the hiking trails at Joaquin miller park)
        </p>
        <p>
            We were planning on doing the Pacific Northwest but given the abnormally cold weather, but we think we're
            just
            gonna play March by ear for now.
